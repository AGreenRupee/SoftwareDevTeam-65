# Project Plan

## Number of sprints

Our sprints are going to last one week each, and we're going to be completing 5 sprints leading up to the functional prototype for Milestone 4, and 10 sprints until the final milestone.

Our current product backlog only contains the user stories/tickets required to satisfy Milestone 4; we will continue to add to it during each sprint, and will add a lot more user stories once we reach Milestone 4 and are able to determine what additional features are feasible to add from there.

## Standup Schedule

Our standups will occur biweekly; one on Wednesday's over Slack, and one in-person on Saturdays. After the Saturday standup, we will also engage in our sprint retrospective, as well as the sprint planning for the next sprint.
